# Rails cheat sheet

## Managing gems

We're using Rails' built-in gem management.  You define gem dependencies in config/environment.rb if the gem should be accessible in development/production/test environments (i.e. the application code calls some library), or in config/environments/*.rb if it applies to only one environment (i.e. a library for testing)

To install gems, run
RAILS_ENV=test rake gems:install
to install all gems needed for development and testing.


# Javascript testing

In order to get Jasmine tests working:
* Install Node.js
* Install NPM
* npm install jasmine-node
* npm install jquery
* npm install jsdom
* npm install htmlparser

Test with 

    rake spec:jasmine


## Tech debt

* Rip out Blue Ridge JS testing plugin
* Migrate legacy Screw.Unit tests to Jasmine
